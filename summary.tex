\chapter{Executive Summary}

In this penetration test the Company X was examined for security-relevant weaknesses. The kind of testing was black-box, this is the kind where no specific information about the internals of the system is given. The scope of the assessment was as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dedicated Web Server: 127.0.0.1
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Domain: https://example.com
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Subdomains: all subdomains
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tbl:web-sites} contains the overview of examined systems during the penetration test.

As a result, several vulnerabilities have been found among the assets of the organization, some of them pose a significant risk. Figure \ref{fig:vuln-by-type} summarizes all issues by their type across all the assets of Company X. Solutions to remedy the discovered vulnerabilities are provided together with detailed descriptions and reproduction steps.

In this part add a short summary of all vulnerabilities in non-technical terms.

It's also good to mention an estimation of efforts required to resolve the issues.

\chapter{Executive Summary}

In this penetration test, the provided VM by the lecturer was assessed for security vulnerabilities. The assessment was conducted between the 18th February and the 18th March as a black box, thus no specific information about the internals of the system was provided. The scope of the assessment was as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Virtual Machine: 10.1.0.10
\end{itemize}

As a result, several vulnerabilities have been found among the assets of the VM, some of them pose a significant risk. Figure \ref{fig:vuln-by-type} summarizes all issues by their type across all the assets. Solutions to remedy the discovered vulnerabilities are provided together with detailed descriptions and reproduction steps in chapter 3.

In this part add a short summary of all vulnerabilities in non-technical terms.

It's also good to mention an estimation of efforts required to resolve the issues.
